# Fashion-MNIST-Classification-with-PyTorch
This project features a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying the Fashion MNIST dataset.
# Fashion MNIST Classification with Custom CNN in PyTorch

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project implements a **custom CNN architecture** for classifying the **Fashion MNIST dataset**, which contains 70,000 grayscale images across 10 clothing categories such as t-shirts, coats, and sneakers.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Custom CNN Architecture:** Built from scratch using PyTorch  
- **Skip Connections:** Improve gradient flow and feature extraction  
- **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Optimize training convergence  
- **Comprehensive Model Evaluation:** Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Achieve optimal training performance  

## 📊 Model Performance
| Metric   | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Training Accuracy | 90%  |
| Test Accuracy      | 87%  |

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is **Fashion MNIST**, available directly in `torchvision.datasets`.
